    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a recent conversation with <a href="http://twitter.com/brandonprry">@brandonprry</a> we asked him how they are using <a href="http://gauntlt.org">gauntlt</a> at his company.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/gauntlt">@gauntlt</a>: What does your company do and what is your role there?</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/brandonprry">@brandonprry</a>: We are game development shop and I am an Application Security Engineer which means I do security penetration testing of our applications and backend services.  Our games talk to a lot of backend web services and web applications.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/gauntlt">@gauntlt</a>: How do you use gauntlt?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><a href="http://twitter.com/brandonprry">@brandonprry</a>: We are just getting started with gauntlt, but there are a couple of ways we started using it.</p>

<p>First, I added the arachni tests to check for XSS (cross site scripting) and injection attacks.  I added some login logic to our gauntlt attacks to engage with the application past the login page.</p>

<p>Second, we have started using the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/Garmr">Garmr</a> attack to check for basic requirements on the page.  <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/Garmr">Garmr</a> is a tool by Mozilla and checks a URL to meet Mozilla&rsquo;s security policy.  You have to sort through the output a bit, but it offers some nice features.  One of the gauntlt attacks we wrote checks to make sure that there are no new login forms.  If Garmr reports one of the login forms as &lsquo;skipped&rsquo; of &lsquo;failure&rsquo; we consider that a failure.  We use this as a way to see if any new login forms have been added to an application.  As a Application Security Engineer, I want to be alerted if there is a new login page somewhere in our application or stack.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/gauntlt">@gauntlt</a>: Wow, that is pretty creative to use Garmr to look for new login forms.  Great idea.  We should make that a usage pattern in Gauntlt in the future.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/brandonprry">@brandonprry</a>: Thanks.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/gauntlt">@gauntlt</a>: Where does gauntlt fit in your deployment pipeline?</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/brandonprry">@brandonprry</a>: Currently this sits at the end, however we are already working on moving this upstream.   Right now I am the gauntlt master so it hasn&rsquo;t spread within the organization yet, but that is the goal.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/gauntlt">@gauntlt</a>: Some people have called gauntlt script-kiddie prevention, what do you think of that?</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/brandonprry">@brandonprry</a>: Well, it makes sense.  Gauntlt can hook some of the popular scanners and make sure that at least a generic scanner won&rsquo;t detect anything glaring.</p>

<p>That said, Gauntlt wont find all the vulnerabilities I will find doing manual penetration testing, but I don&rsquo;t think that is the goal.  What I like about gauntlt is that I can find problems, write gauntlt attacks to replicate the issue and use that to reproduce the issue with the dev team.  I also like that it serves as a way to prevent security regressions.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/gauntlt">@gauntlt</a>: Thanks for taking time to chat with us on this.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/brandonprry">@brandonprry</a>: Thanks.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At AppSecUSA in Austin, TX there was a track devoted to Rugged DevOps and this talk featured the team from the <a href="http://gauntlt.org">gauntlt project</a>.  What is great about gauntlt is that you can start implementing a few security tests right in line with your smoke tests (or whatever you call them) and if you are already using cucumber then it will come naturally to you.</p>

<p>The video walks you through an intro to rugged devops, how to install gauntlt and first steps at getting started.  Before you watch it go ahead and install the gauntlt gem.</p>

<p> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/54250714">Gauntlt: Rugged by Example &ndash; Jeremiah Shirk, Mani Tadayon, James Wickett</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/appsecusa">OWASP AppSec USA</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p> <p>Title: Gauntlt: Rugged by Example<br /> <br /> Abstract<br /> <br /> &quot;Be Mean to Your Code&quot; is the concept behind the ruggedization framework called Gauntlt (pronounced like gauntlet) which aims to bring the benefits of Behaviour Driven Development to the realms of automated security testing, application hardening and ruggedization. Gauntlt is an open source ruggedization framework using cucumber and written in ruby. Gauntlt has been developed in collaboration with Netflix to fulfill the role of the &quot;Security Monkey&quot; in their Simian Army&mdash;most popularly known for the Chaos Monkey.<br /> <br /> Gauntlt is meant to be used by security experts with interest in automation as well as developers with interest in security. It can be used to deliver the results of a security audit or penetration test via failing gauntlt attacks (tests) which can in turn be added to the continuous delivery test suite. Developers know when they have resolved a particular vulnerability when gauntlt no longer reports a failure. Gauntlt can be used in regression tests to detect when a previously resolved vulnerability has been re-introduced.<br /> <br /> The creators of Gauntlt, James Wickett, Mani Tadayon and Roy Rapoport, will talk about the history of the project, current roadmap and the planned security testing tools being added to Gauntlt. As part of this talk we will do a hands on demo where we will walk the audience through getting started using gauntlt pre-built attacks and then move to writing their own gauntlt attacks. Come find out how to start being &quot;rugged by example&quot; and how to get started with Gauntlt.<br /> <br /> Note: Jeremiah Shirk is filling in for Roy Rapoport.<br /> <br /> <br /> Gauntlt is MIT Licensed and hosted on github at <a href="http://github.com/thegauntlet/gauntlt.">http://github.com/thegauntlet/gauntlt.</a><br /> <strong><strong><em><br /> <br /> Speakers<br /> <br /> Jeremiah Shirk, Integration &amp; Infrastructure Manager, Kansas State University<br /> <br /> Jeremiah is the Integration &amp; Infrastructure Manager for Kansas State University. He is working to evangelize security as an integral component of all phases of the software life cycle, from design, development, and testing, through to delivery, operations, and user interaction. He has been active in computer and network security since 2000, starting out in the trenches of firewall administration, malware research, and penetration testing. His current interests include data visualization, growing the DevOps community, and building reliable systems through infrastructure-as-code. Ask him about his ducks. <br /> <br /> Mani Tadayon, Senior Software Engineer, ZestFinance<br /> <br /> I love programming and am now learning Clojure, Lisp and Emacs. Since 2001, I&#039;ve worked in web development, constantly updating my skills to keep up with new technologies, moving from .NET to php to ruby and beyond. At the same time, I&#039;ve discovered the importance of strong foundations and continue to re-learn c, html and javascript. My educational background is broad: a bachelor&#039;s in Chinese, Japanese &amp; German from UC Berkeley and a second bachelor&#039;s in Computer Science (with a minor in Math) from CSU Hayward. Currently, I am a graduate student in Geography at CSU Northridge. My current interests are in functional programming, logic and philosophy. I hope to pursue academic research in these fields alongside my career as a programmer. I took a small step down that path with my recently published paper on the philosophy of AVP: Alien vs. Predator. <br /> <br /> James Wickett, Senior DevOps Engineer, Mentor Graphics<br /> <br /> James is an innovative thought leader in the DevOps and InfoSec communities and has a passion for helping big companies work like startups to deliver products in the cloud. He got his start in technology when he ran a Web startup company as a student at University of Oklahoma and since then has worked in environments ranging from large, web-scale enterprises to small, rapid-growth startups. As a Senior DevOps Engineer, James is working on launching cloud based-products for the Embedded Software Division of Mentor Graphics.<br /> <br /> James is a dynamic speaker on topics in cloud computing, cloud security and Rugged DevOps. He is the creator and founder of the Lonestar Application Security Conference which is the largest annual security conference in Austin, TX. He holds the following security certifications: CISSP, GWAPT, GCFW, GSEC and CCSK. <br /> <br /> </em></strong></strong><br /> Date:Thursday October 25, 2012 10:00am &ndash; 10:45am <br /> Location: AppSecUSA, Austin, TX.
